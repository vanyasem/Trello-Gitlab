# Trello GitLab Power-Up

**Foxes love nice things, too.**

GitLab API can be terribly slow at times (request times up to 20 seconds) which doesn't fit in a one-second concept used by Trello.

This Power-Up is WIP, however, if you want to try this out right away without waiting for it to get released - put this url (https://peacedoorball.ru/trello/manifest.json) into the prompt on https://trello.com/power-up-preview then you will see a new Power-Up called 'GitLab' show up in your list of Power-Ups.
