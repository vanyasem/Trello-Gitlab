# Trello GitLab Power-Up

**Foxes love nice things, too.**

~~GitLab API can be terribly slow at times (request times up to 20 seconds) which doesn't fit in a one-second concept used by Trello.~~ GitLab Team finally noticed that their API works like crap: [#33748](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/33748), [#34159](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/34159) [#35208](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/35208), [!12595](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/12595)

This Power-Up is WIP, however, if you want to try it out right away without waiting for the release - put this url (https://trello.mynameisivan.ru/manifest.json) into the prompt [here](https://trello.com/power-up-preview) then you will see a new Power-Up called 'GitLab' show up in your list of Power-Ups.
